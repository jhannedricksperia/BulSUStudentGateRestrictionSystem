BulSU Student Gate Restriction System

The BulSU Student Gate Restriction System is a digital monitoring and access-control solution designed to manage and restrict student entry across the different campuses of Bulacan State University. Its primary goal is to ensure that only authorized students with valid credentials—including campus-specific access permissions—are allowed to enter designated university gates.
This system enhances campus security by providing real-time verification, reducing unauthorized entries, and supporting efficient monitoring for campus personnel. Featuring both web and mobile platforms, it streamlines the validation process and ensures seamless coordination between administrators and gate security officers.

Key Goal
- To limit and regulate student entrance to BulSU campuses by verifying identity, enrollment status, and access privileges through a centralized digital system.
